[1;91m[-] [0mHmm, your system is configured to send core dump notifications to an
    external utility. This will cause issues: there will be an extended delay
    between stumbling upon a crash and having this information relayed to the
    fuzzer via the standard waitpid() API.
    If you're just testing, set 'AFL_I_DONT_CARE_ABOUT_MISSING_CRASHES=1'.

    To avoid having crashes misinterpreted as timeouts, please log in as root
    and temporarily modify /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, like so:

    echo core >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

[1;91m[-] [0mOops, the program crashed with one of the test cases provided. There are
    several possible explanations:

    - The test case causes known crashes under normal working conditions. If
      so, please remove it. The fuzzer should be seeded with interesting
      inputs - but not ones that cause an outright crash.

    - In QEMU persistent mode the selected address(es) for the loop are not
      properly cleaning up variables and memory. Try adding
      AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_GPR=1 or select better addresses in the binary.

    - Least likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options
      fail, poke the Awesome Fuzzing Discord for troubleshooting tips.
